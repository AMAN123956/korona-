    <h2>What is Covid-19?</h2>
    <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by
        the “novel corona virus”. Common
        symptoms are:
        Fever
        Dry cough
        Breathing difficulty
        Some patients also have aches and pains,
        nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or
        diarrhoea
        About 80% of confirmed cases recover from the disease
        without any serious complications. However, one out
        of every six people who gets COVID-19 can become
        seriously ill* and develop difficulty in breathing. In more
        severe cases, infection can cause severe pneumonia
        and other complications which can be treated only at
        higher level facilities (District Hospitals and above).</p>

        <h2>How Does It Spreads</h2>
        <p>How does COVID-19 spread?
            COVID-19 spreads mainly by droplets produced
            as a result of coughing or sneezing of a COVID-19
            infected person. This can happen in two ways:<br>
            > <span class="primary">Direct close contact</span>: one can get the infection
            by being in close contact with COVID-19
            patients (within one Metre of the infected
            person), especially if they do not cover their
            face when coughing or sneezing.<br>
            > <span class="primary">Indirect contact</span>: the droplets survive on
            surfaces and clothes for many days. Therefore,
            touching any such infected surface or cloth
            and then touching one’s mouth, nose or eyes
            can transmit the disease.
            The incubation period of COVID 19 (time between
            getting the infection and showing symptoms) is
            1 to 14 days
            Some people <br>with the infection, but without any
            serious symptoms can also spread the disease.</p>

        <h2>Source of Virus</h2>
       
        <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

            COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p>
